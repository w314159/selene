### SEA OF TIME

同船度此生（泰戈尔《飞鸟集》242）

> This life is the crossing of a sea, where we meet in the same narrow ship. In death we reach the shore and go to our different worlds. 

横越时间海（泰戈尔《飞鸟集》244）

> My heart is homesick today for the one sweet hour across the sea of time.

在另一个世界的晨曦中（泰戈尔《飞鸟集》291）

> Some day I shall sing to thee in the sunrise of some other world, "I have seen thee before in the light of the earth, in the love of man."
